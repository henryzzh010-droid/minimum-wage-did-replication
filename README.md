## Research Question

Does an increase in the minimum wage reduce employment in the fast-food industry?

## Identification Strategy

This project replicates the Difference-in-Differences (DID) strategy used in the original paper.

The treatment group consists of fast-food restaurants in New Jersey, where the minimum wage increased in 1992.  
The control group consists of restaurants in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage did not change.

The DID estimator compares the change in employment in New Jersey before and after the policy change to the corresponding change in Pennsylvania.

The key identifying assumption is the **parallel trends assumption**:  
In the absence of the minimum wage increase, employment trends in New Jersey and Pennsylvania would have evolved similarly.
